## What Was This Study About?

This study examined how different factors influence investment decisions when people interpret financial charts. Specifically, we were interested in:

- **News headlines:** Whether positive, negative, or ambiguous headlines above charts shift people's investment choices, even when the chart data itself is the key information.
- **Uncertainty visualization:** Whether showing multiple projected scenarios (bull, base, bear) versus a single projection changes how confident people feel and what they choose.
- **Chart difficulty:** Whether people can distinguish between assets with higher vs. lower expected returns when the difference is small.

## Important Note

All charts and investment scenarios in this study were **hypothetical**. The historical price data was drawn from real market indices but was rescaled and does not represent any specific investment recommendation. The projected lines were generated by the research team to create controlled experimental conditions.
