# Study Instructions

## Your Task

In this study, you will act as an investor making a series of decisions. On each trial, you will choose between two investment options for a hypothetical **$100 investment**:

### Option A — A Charted Asset
You will see a chart showing:
- **Solid line (left side):** The asset's historical performance over the past 60 days.
- **Dashed line(s) (right side):** The asset's projected performance over the next 60 days.
- The **y-axis** shows the **Investment Return (%)** — how much you would gain or lose on your $100 investment. A value of 0% means you break even; +10% means you earn $10 profit; -5% means you lose $5.
- Some charts may include a **news headline** above the chart providing market context.
- Some charts may show **multiple projected lines** (Bull, Base, Bear) representing optimistic, baseline, and pessimistic scenarios.

### Option B — A Fixed-Odds Investment
A simple investment with known odds:
- **55% chance** of earning a **$10 profit** (10% return on your $100)
- **45% chance** of earning **$0 profit** (0% return — you simply get your $100 back)
- This option's expected profit is **$5.50** (or a 5.5% expected return).

## How to Decide

On each trial, compare what the chart suggests about Option A's likely return to the known expected return of Option B (5.5%). Choose whichever option you believe gives you the better investment.

There are no trick questions — use your best judgment based on the information provided.
